Following an email conversation, I've started on the whole web scraping spiel. It begins with this Tour de France project I've been working on.

While a Kaggle dataset was available, to really get the in-depth data I was interested in, I instead used the procyclingstats website to extract full stage information. This involved writing a number of functions to scrape then correctly format data, including team time trials.
