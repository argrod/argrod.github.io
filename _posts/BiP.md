## The Biologging Intelligence Platform

Animals moving in their natural environments will be affected by their external environment, for instance, the pressure a whale or turtle experiences during a dive. As a result, these animals provide ideal samplers of typically hard-to-reach parts of the globe. As biologging has become more 'accessible' due to miniaturisation of technology, decrease in cost, weight etc., the widespread adoption of biologging across the globe provides an opportunity to maximise the potential of those collected data.

However, doing so is considerably more tricky than it seems. Often the application of researchers' methods are difficult and can require considerable computing power. The Biologging intelligence Platform (BiP) is a means to counteract this. By producing an OnLine Analytical Processing (OLAP) system, users can apply complex analyses to uploaded data through an easy-to-use system.
