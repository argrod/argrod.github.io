                Biologging is the name given to a method of studying animals in their natural habitat by attaching data loggers that can record data as the animal travels/behaves within or outside of an experiment. This way of study allows data collection on animals that <em>ideally</em> are behaving in a way that is natural for them.

                The basis of my PhD was examining foraging decisions by streaked shearwaters. This was based on combinations of acceleration, GPS, and video recordings by onboard tags.
