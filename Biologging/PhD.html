                    <p>During my PhD, I examined acceleration, GPS, video, and gyroscopic records of streaked shearwaters nesting in Japan. The purpose of my research was to examine and extract trends of movement during foraging trips of shearwaters, specifically as related to local wind conditions.b </p>
