I recently completed a PhD in Data Science focussed on marine ecology at the University of Tokyo which I followed up with a postdoc position developing an online analytical processing system, where complex analyses are applied to large wearables datasets via an easy-to-use system.

        <p>
            Biologging is the name given to a way of studying animals by attaching data loggers that can record data as the animal travels/behaves within or outside of an experiment. This way of study allows data collection on animals that <em>ideally</em> are behaving in a way that is natural for them.
