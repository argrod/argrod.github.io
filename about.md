My research started with a Natural Sciences BSc, the second year of which I spent at UC Santa Cruz, where I spent a lot of time at the Long Marine Lab. This kick-started an interest in the research of marine mammals - in particular, biologging, where data loggers are attached to animals to learn about what they do in their natural habitat.

I went on to learn more on biologging and statistical modelling during my [head motion project]({% post_url 2023-07-10-MProj %}), along with digital signal processing of acoustic signals.

I was later hired to develop a BOEM governmental report on wind farm installation at the Univeristy of Maryland, where I developed automated acoustic recorders, validated results of C-POD devices, and analysed behavioural data and acoustic data responses to tropical storms.

More recently, I completed a PhD in Data Science focussed on marine ecology at the University of Tokyo. I was then employed in a postdoc position developing an [online analytical processing system]({% post_url 2023-07-10-BiP %}), where complex analyses are applied to large wearables datasets via an easy-to-use system.

        <p>
            Biologging is the name given to a way of studying animals by attaching data loggers that can record data as the animal travels/behaves within or outside of an experiment. This way of study allows data collection on animals that <em>ideally</em> are behaving in a way that is natural for them.
