                    <p>Biologging is the name given to a way of studying animals by attaching data loggers that can record data as the animal travels/behaves within or outside of an experiment. This way of study allows data collection on animals that <em>ideally</em> are behaving in a way that is natural for them.</p>

                        During my PhD, I examined acceleration, GPS, video, and gyroscopic records of streaked shearwaters nesting in Japan. The purpose of my research was to examine and extract trends of movement during foraging trips of shearwaters, specifically as related to local wind conditions.b 
                        
                        I undertook a short thesis study on head motion in toothed whales (odontocetes) as part of my Master's study. This all came about as I was interested in the skeletal structure of odontocete cervical vertebrae.
