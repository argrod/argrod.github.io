title: Inferring head motion in odontocetes
---

## Wearable audio arrays

In my Master's thesis, I explored the effects (if any) of different head morphologies in toothed whales, specifically as it pertains to lateral motion. Most toothed whales and dolphins have an intriguing trait in their fused cervical (neck) vertebrae (belugas and narwhals are notable exceptions). This clearly limits motion in the cervical region, so the question posed was, do whales move their heads laterally, and if so, how does that vary across the diverse head shapes seen in these animals?
